Python syntax and data types for security scripts

### Basic Python syntax

- **Comments:** 
    - Single-line comments start with `#`.
    - Multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

- **Variables:** 
    - Variables are created by assigning a value to a name using the `=` operator.
    - Variable names must start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    - Example: `my_variable = 10`

- **Control structures:**
    - if-else statements:
    - ```python
        if condition:
            # code to execute if condition is true
        else:
            # code to execute if condition is false
        ```
    - for loops:
    - ```python
        for item in iterable:
            # code to execute for each item in the iterable
        ```
    - while loops:
    - ```python
        while condition:
            # code to execute while condition is true
        ```

### Data types

### Working with files

Working with files in Python involves reading from, writing to, and manipulating data stored in various formats, which is essential for tasks such as log analysis, data processing, and security automation. By mastering file handling techniques, we can manage and analyze the data that drives our security operations efficiently. Here is the syntax for reading and writing files:

- **Reading files:**
    - To read a file, we can use the `open()` function with the `'r'` mode (read mode). We can then read the contents of the file using methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`.
    - Example:
    ```python
     with open('log.txt', 'r') as file:
        logs = file.readlines()
        for line in logs:
            print(line.strip())
    ```
- **Writing files:**
    - To write to a file, we can use the `open()` function with the `'w'` mode (write mode) or `'a'` mode (append mode). We can then write data to the file using the `write()` or `writelines()` methods.
    - Example:
    ```python
    with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write('This is a test.\n')
        file.write('Writing to a file.\n')
    ```

### Class and Object
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
- **Object:** An instance of a class. It contains data and methods defined in the class.

Example:
```python
# Define a class
Class Car:
    # Define the constructor
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
    
    # Define a method
    def show_info(self): 
        print(f"{self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}")

# Create an object of the class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
# Call the method
my_car.show_info()  # Output: 2020 Toyota Corolla
```
- ```__init__` method: A special method called a constructor that initializes the object's attributes when an object is created.
- `self` parameter: A reference to the current instance of the class, allowing access to its attributes and methods.
- `Attributes`: Variables that hold data related to the object.
- `Methods`: Functions defined within the class that operate on the object's attributes or perform actions related to the object.

#### Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

Example:
```python
# Define a parent class
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, barand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model
    def show_info(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model}")

# Define a child class that inherits from Vehicle
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
        super().__init__(brand, model)  # Call the parent class constructor
        self.year = year
    
    def show_info(self):
        super().show_info()  # Call the parent class method
        print(f"Year: {self.year}")
    # Define a method specific to the child class
    def start_engine(self):
        print("Engine started.")

# Create an object of the child class
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
car.show_info()  # Output: Toyota Corolla Year: 2020
my_car.start_engine()  # Output: Engine started.
```
- `super()` function: A built-in function that allows access to methods and attributes of the parent class from the child class.
- `Method overriding`: The child class can provide its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class, allowing for customized behavior while still retaining the parent class's functionality.
  
#### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a programming concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to behave differently based on the object invoking it, promoting flexibility and code reusability.
Example:
```python
class Bird:
    def sound(self):
        print("Chirp chirp!")

class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        print("Woof woof!")

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        print("Meow meow!")

# Sử dụng đa hình
animals = [Bird(), Dog(), Cat()]

for animal in animals:
    animal.sound()
# Output:
# Chirp chirp!
# Woof woof!
# Meow meow!
```

##### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that restricts direct access to an object's attributes and methods, allowing controlled interaction through public methods. This promotes data hiding, enhances security, and improves code maintainability.
Example:
```python
Class BankAccount:
    def __init__ (self, owner, balance):
        self.owner = owner  # Public attribute
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited: {amount}")
        else:
            print("Invalid deposit amount.")
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if 0 < amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrawn: {amount}")
        else:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount.")
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance  # Public method to access private attribute

# Create an object of the class
my_account = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)

# call public methods
my_account.deposit(500)  # Output: Deposited: 500
my_account.withdraw(200)  # Output: Withdrawn: 200
print(my_account.get_balance())  # Output: 1300

# accessing private attributes directly will raise an error
print(my_account.__balance)  # AttributeError: 'BankAccount' object has no attribute '__balance'
```
- **Public attributes/methods:** Accessible from outside the class.
- **Private attributes/methods:** Prefixed with `__` and not accessible from outside the class.
- **Public methods:** Can be called from outside the class.
- **Private methods:** Prefixed with `__` and not accessible from outside the class.
- **Getters and Setters:** Public methods that allow controlled access to private attributes. Getters retrieve the value, while setters modify it.

### Exception handling
In Python, exception handling is a mechanism that allows us to handle errors and exceptions gracefully without crashing the program. It enables us to catch and respond to specific errors, ensuring that our code can continue executing or provide meaningful feedback to the user. using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks, we can manage exceptions effectively.

Example:
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
else:
    print("No exceptions occurred.")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")
```
- `try` block: Contains code that may raise an exception.
- `except` block: Catches and handles specific exceptions.
- `else` block: Executes if no exceptions occur in the `try` block.
- `finally` block: Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred, often used for cleanup actions.

**Multiple exceptions:**
```python
try:
    # Code that may raise multiple exceptions
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(f"Result: {result}")
except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

- In this example, we catch both `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError` in a single `except` block using a tuple. The variable `e` holds the exception object, allowing us to access its message.
- This approach simplifies error handling when multiple exceptions can occur in the same block of code.

custom exception:
```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    """Custom exception class."""
    pass
try:
    # Code that may raise a custom exception
    raise CustomError("This is a custom error.")
except CustomError as e:
    print(f"Custom error occurred: {e}")
```
- In this example, we define a custom exception class `CustomError` that inherits from the built-in `Exception` class. We can raise this custom exception using the `raise` statement and catch it in the `except` block.
- This allows us to create specific error types tailored to our application's needs, making it easier to handle and debug errors.
- Custom exceptions can be useful for defining application-specific error conditions, improving code readability, and providing meaningful error messages to users or developers.

### Requests HTTP and API
Python offers a powerful library called `requests` that simplifies making HTTP requests and interacting with APIs. This library allows us to send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other types of requests to web servers, making it an essential tool for security professionals working with web applications and APIs.

#### GET request
```python
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
if response.status_code ==200:
    data = response.json()  # Parse JSON response
    print(data)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```
- `response.status_code`: The HTTP status code returned by the server, indicating the success or failure of the request.
- `response.json()`: A method that parses the JSON response from the server into a Python dictionary or list, making it easy to work with the data.
- `response.text`: A method that retrieves the raw text response from the server, which can be useful for debugging or when the response is not in JSON format.
- `response.headers`: A dictionary containing the response headers, which can provide additional information about the response, such as content type, server information, and caching directives.
- `response.content`: A method that retrieves the raw binary content of the response, which can be useful for downloading files or handling non-text data.

#### POST request
```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
data = {'key': 'value'}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
if response.status_code == 201:
    print("Data created successfully.")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

- `requests.post()`: A method that sends a POST request to the specified URL with the provided data. The `json` parameter automatically serializes the data to JSON format.
- `json=data`: A parameter that specifies the data to be sent in the request body, automatically converting it to JSON format.

#### headers and params
```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
params = {'param1': 'value1', 'param2': 'value2'}
headers = {'User-Agent': 'MyApp/1.0'}
response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")

```

- `params`: A dictionary of query parameters to be included in the URL. The `requests` library automatically encodes these parameters and appends them to the URL.
- `headers`: A dictionary of HTTP headers to be included in the request. This can be used to specify additional information about the request, such as authentication tokens, content types, and user agents.

#### Handling errors 
```python
import requests

try:
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
    print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as req_err:
    print(f"Request error occurred: {req_err}")
```

- `response.raise_for_status()`: A method that raises an exception if the response status code indicates an error (4xx or 5xx). This allows us to handle HTTP errors more effectively.
- `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`: An exception raised for HTTP errors, allowing us to catch and handle specific error conditions.
- `requests.RequestException`: A base class for all exceptions raised by the `requests` library, allowing us to catch any request-related errors.

### JSON and Environment variables

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is widely used for data exchange between web applications and APIs. In Python, we can work with JSON data using the built-in `json` module.

#### JSON syntax
- JSON data is represented as key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`.
- Keys must be strings, and values can be strings, numbers, arrays, objects, or booleans.
- Arrays are represented as ordered lists enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
- Example:
```json
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "is_student": false,
    "courses": ["Math", "Science"],
    "address": {
        "city": "New York",
        "zip": "10001"
    }
}
```
- In this example, we have a JSON object with various data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and nested objects.
- JSON is commonly used for data exchange in web applications, APIs, and configuration files due to its simplicity and readability.

#### Working with JSON in Python

- To work with JSON data in Python, we can use the `json` module, which provides methods for encoding (serializing) and decoding (deserializing) JSON data.
- **Encoding JSON:**
```python
import json
data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "is_student": False,
    "courses": ["Math", "Science"],
    "address": {
        "city": "New York",
        "zip": "10001"
    }
}
json_data = json.dumps(data)  # Convert Python object to JSON string
print(json_data)
```
- **Decoding JSON:**
```python
import json
json_data = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "is_student": false, "courses": ["Math", "Science"], "address": {"city": "New York", "zip": "10001"}}'
data = json.loads(json_data)  # Convert JSON string to Python object
print(data)
print(data['name'])  # Output: Alice
```
- `json.dumps()`: A method that converts a Python object (e.g., dictionary, list) to a JSON string.
- `json.loads()`: A method that converts a JSON string to a Python object (e.g., dictionary, list).
- `json.dump()`: A method that writes a Python object to a file in JSON format.
- `json.load()`: A method that reads a JSON file and converts it to a Python object.

### Environment variables
Environment variables are key-value pairs stored in the operating system's environment, allowing us to configure settings and store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) without hardcoding them in our code. In Python, we can access and manage environment variables using the `os` module.

Setting environment variables:
- In Linux/Mac:
```bash
export MY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```
- In Windows:
```bash
set MY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Reading environment variables in Python:
```python
import os
api_key = os.getenv('MY_API_KEY')
print(api_key)
```

Using .env files:
- To manage environment variables in a more organized way, we can use `.env` files. These files store key-value pairs in a simple text format, making it easy to load them into our Python application.
- To use `.env` files, we can use the `python-dotenv` library, which allows us to load environment variables from a `.env` file into our application's environment.
- Install the library:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```
create a `.env` file:
```
MY_API_KEY=your_api_key
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
```
- Load the `.env` file in Python:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env file
api_key = os.getenv('MY_API_KEY')
db_password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
print(api_key)
print(db_password)
```

- `load_dotenv()`: A function that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the application's environment, making them accessible using `os.getenv()`.
- `os.getenv()`: A method that retrieves the value of an environment variable by its key. If the variable is not found, it returns `None` or a specified default value.
- This approach allows us to manage sensitive information and configuration settings securely and conveniently, keeping them separate from our codebase.

### Handing input command line (argparse)

`argparse` is a built-in Python module that provides a simple way to handle command-line arguments and options in our scripts. It allows us to define expected arguments, parse them from the command line, and access their values in our code. This is particularly useful for creating user-friendly command-line interfaces for our security scripts.

```python
import argparse

# Create an ArgumentParser object
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='A simple script to demonstrate argparse.')

# Add arguments
parser.add_argument('input_file', type=str, help='Path to the input file')
parser.add_argument('-o', '--output', type=str, help='Path to the output file', default='output.txt')
parser.add_argument('-v', '--verbose', action='store_true', help='Enable verbose output')

# Parse the command-line arguments
args = parser.parse_args()

# Access the arguments
print(f"Input file: {args.input_file}")
print(f"Output file: {args.output}")
```
- `ArgumentParser`: A class that creates a command-line argument parser.
- `add_argument()`: A method that defines the expected arguments and their properties, such as type, help message, and default values.
- `parse_args()`: A method that parses the command-line arguments and returns an object containing the values of the defined arguments.
- `args`: An object that contains the parsed arguments, allowing us to access their values using dot notation (e.g., `args.input_file`, `args.output`).
- `action='store_true'`: A special action that stores `True` if the argument is provided and `False` if it is not. This is commonly used for boolean flags.
- `help`: A parameter that provides a description of the argument, which is displayed when the user runs the script with the `-h` or `--help` option.
- `default`: A parameter that specifies the default value for the argument if it is not provided by the user.
- `type`: A parameter that specifies the expected data type of the argument, allowing automatic type conversion during parsing.
- `choices`: A parameter that restricts the possible values for the argument to a predefined set, ensuring that only valid options are accepted.
- `required`: A parameter that specifies whether the argument is mandatory or optional. If set to `True`, the script will raise an error if the argument is not provided.

### Muti-threading
Multi-threading is a programming technique that allows multiple threads (smaller units of a process) to run concurrently within a single program. This can improve performance and responsiveness, especially in I/O-bound tasks, such as network requests or file operations. In Python, we can use the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class from the `concurrent.futures` module to manage threads easily.
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import time

def task(n):
    print(f"Task {n} started.")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a time-consuming task
    print(f"Task {n} completed.")
    return n * 2
# Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with a specified number of threads
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    # Submit tasks to the executor
    futures = [executor.submit(task, i) for i in range(5)]
    # Wait for all tasks to complete and retrieve results
    results = [future.result() for future in futures]
    print("Results:", results)
```

- `ThreadPoolExecutor`: A class that manages a pool of threads, allowing us to submit tasks for concurrent execution.
- `max_workers`: A parameter that specifies the maximum number of threads in the pool. This controls the level of concurrency.
- `submit()`: A method that submits a task (function) to the executor for execution in a separate thread. It returns a `Future` object representing the result of the task.
- `Future`: An object that represents the result of a task that may not have completed yet. We can use it to check the status of the task or retrieve its result.
- `result()`: A method that blocks until the task is completed and returns the result. If the task raised an exception, it will be re-raised when calling `result()`.
- `with` statement: A context manager that automatically handles the cleanup of the executor when the block is exited, ensuring that all threads are properly terminated.
